# Spaceship Battle Game

Welcome to Spaceship Battle, an action-packed spaceship shooting game! Take control of your spaceship, shoot down enemy ships, and collect shields to protect yourself.

## Overview

In Spaceship Battle, you control a spaceship with the goal of destroying as many enemy ships as possible. The more ships you destroy, the more points you earn. But be careful! The enemies will be shooting back at you.

The game features different types of enemy ships, power-ups, and a scoring system.

## Features

- **Spaceship with 3 Lives**: Your spaceship has 3 lives. Be cautious as you can lose lives by enemy bullets or colliding with enemy ships.
  
- **Multiple Enemy Types**: The game has a dynamic difficulty. For every 3 regular ships you destroy, a stronger Predator appears. For every 3 Predators, a Golden ship appears, and for every 3 Golden ships, an Alien ship appears.

- **Shield Power-up**: Catch the shield power-up for temporary immunity against enemy bullets. Note that the shield will not protect you from collisions with enemy ships. Shields appear randomly and have a random duration, indicated by an on-screen timer.

- **Endless Gameplay**: There's no end to the game; try to achieve the highest score possible!

- **Scoring System**: Earn points for each enemy ship you destroy. The tougher the enemy, the more points you earn.

## Controls

- `Arrow keys`: Move your spaceship.
- `Spacebar`: Shoot bullets.

## Scoring

For each enemy ship you shot down, you get 1 point.
